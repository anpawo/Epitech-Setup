# custom-setup

My custom setup for linux during Epitech  
I'm using gnome on Fedora 39

# configurations

- aliases for my shell
- settings for my current shell (__fish__), and the one I had before (__zsh__)
- aliases for firefox
- some custom command (binary)
- lots of tester for every project
- vscode extensions, settings, user snippets, which are not the default ones (clangd)
- shortcut for fedora
